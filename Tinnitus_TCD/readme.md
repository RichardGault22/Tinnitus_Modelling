This folder contains the code for the paper: "A Computational Model of Thalamocortical Dysrhythmia in Tinnitus Sufferers" which can be found through google scholar.

This introduction will give an overview of the files available and how to use the files to generate the simulated modelling results for the Central Auditory Processing (CAP) model.

Indepth details regarding the implementation can be found in the comments of each file. If you require further details, please do not hesitate to contact me.

<h1>Pre-requisites<h1>

All files have been run with MATLAB 2017a. The files may also run on other versions of MATLAB with possible errors arising from changes to in built MATLAB functions.

The ear model requires the Carney ear model (2014, Zilany et al. model) to be [downloaded](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/carney/publications/auditory-models.aspx) and compiled with the resulting files being placed in the same directory as the files for the CAP model.

<h1>Files available<h1>

The most simple way to explore the CAP model is to begin by replicating the figures from the original paper. The files 
- figure_4-5.m
- figure_6.m
- figure_8-9.m
- figure_10-11.m
- figure_12-14.m
- figure_13.m

provide the corresponding code for the canonical figure.
